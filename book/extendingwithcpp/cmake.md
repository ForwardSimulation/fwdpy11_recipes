# Building with cmake

It is arguably easiest to build extension with [cmake](https://www.cmake.org).
The `pybind11` [documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable) gives instructions on how to do so.

The `CMakeLists.txt` to build the C++ components of the `fp11recipes` module accompanying this book looks like this:

```{literalinclude} ../../fp11recipes/CMakeLists.txt
:language: cmake
```
