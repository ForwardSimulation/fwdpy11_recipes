# Preface

```{python getversion, echo=FALSE}
import fwdpy11
fp11_version = fwdpy11.__version__
```

This book provides additional recipes for the [fwdpy11](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy11) simulation software.
The recipes complement examples found in the [primary documentation](https://fwdpy11.readthedocs.io).
Some recipes may be repeated here.

The book is written using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).
The `Python` code blocks are executed via [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).
The book is always current with respect to the current `fwdpy11` [release](https://pypi.org/project/fwdpy11/).

The contents of this book are generated using `fwdpy11` version `r py$fp11_version`.
