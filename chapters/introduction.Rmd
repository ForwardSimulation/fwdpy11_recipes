# Introduction

## Modern Python

The examples in this book use several modern Python features:

* Functions are defined with [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html).
* Class definitions usually use [attrs](https://www.attrs.org).

## Key imports

The following imports will be used throughout:

```{python keyimports, code=xfun::read_utf8('recipes/introduction/keyimports.py')}
```

The `fp11recipes` is a small Python module included with the [source code](https://github.com/ForwardSimulation/fwdpy11_recipes) for this book.
