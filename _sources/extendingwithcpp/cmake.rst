Building with cmake
===================================================================

It is arguably easiest to build extension with `cmake <https://www.cmake.org>`_.
The `pybind11` `documentation <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ gives instructions on how to do so.

The `CMakeLists.txt` to build the C++ components of the `fp11recipes` module accompanying this book looks like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../fp11recipes/CMakeLists.txt
